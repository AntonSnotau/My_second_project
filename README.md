# My_second_project

Hi,
this is my second project - searching for a job is one of the most difficult things for me, it's a real challenge, to face which I need a lot of motivation. So my second project is dedicated to uprise self-evaluation of person visiting my page by sharing quotes of really great people about life, work and love.
To create this page I used simple HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. I also didn't had a server to upload quotes and didn't want to use the public one, so quotes are unique, that's why I wrote them all in HTML as <ul>.

Enjoy & thank you for attention!
